# Pomerium

Pomerium is an identity-aware proxy that enables secure access to internal applications. Pomerium provides a standardized interface to add access control to applications regardless of whether the application itself has authorization or authentication baked-in

## Pomerium Setup

This document is intended to give a brief overview on how Pomerium can be implemented, for further details, please look at the official doc : <https://www.pomerium.io/docs/>

## Setup

the base kustomization component present [here](./kustomization.yaml) allows to quickly integrate this service with an existing Dex service that very likely is connected to an LDAP.

In order to do so, you will need to edit your Dex configuration, adding a static client to be used by Pomerium, like in the example below:

```yaml
>>staticClients:
    - id: "pomerium-auth-client"
      secret: "your-super-secret"
      name: "Pomerium"
      redirectURIs:
       - "https://pomerium.example.com/oauth2/callback"
```

setting the redirectURIs, accordingly with the host you used for the pomerium ingress.

Once do that, you will need to use ovverride the configuration example ([policy](./config/policy.example.yaml) and environment variables as [configmap](./config/config.example.env) and [secret](secrets/pomerium.example.env)) like in the example above:

```yaml
configMapGenerator:
  - name: pomerium-policy
    behavior: replace
    files:
      - policy.yml=config/pomerium-policy.yml
  - name: pomerium
    behavior: replace
    envs:
      - config/pomerium-config.env

secretGenerator:
  - name: pomerium-env
    behavior: replace
    envs:
      - secrets/pomerium.env
```

just copy the examples in the module and override them accordingly with your settings.

**âš  WARNING: in the policy file, you'll need to setup many policy as many ingress you want to protect under the pomerium authorization service.**

## Ingresses

Once do that, Pomerium and Dex and correctly configured.
The only missing step is to add annotations to the ingresses you've added previously in the policy yaml file:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    forecastle.stakater.com/expose: "true"
    forecastle.stakater.com/appName: "Prometheus"
    forecastle.stakater.com/icon: "https://github.com/stakater/ForecastleIcons/raw/master/prometheus.png"
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: "internal"
    kubernetes.io/tls-acme: "true"
    # authentication annotations
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-url: "https://pomerium.example.com/verify?uri=$scheme://$host$request_uri"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-signin: "https://pomerium.example.com/?uri=$scheme://$host$request_uri"
  name: prometheus
  namespace: monitoring
spec:
  rules:
    - host: prometheus.example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            backend:
              serviceName: prometheus-k8s
              servicePort: web
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - prometheus.example.com
      secretName: prometheus-tls
```

Now if you'll try to reach the `prometheus.example.com` you'll be forwarded to the dex login page accordingly with the rules set in your policy. Enjoy!
