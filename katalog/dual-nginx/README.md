# Ingress Dual NGINX

<!-- <KFD-DOCS> -->

Ingress NGINX is an Ingress Controller for [NGINX][nginx-page] webserver and reverse proxy, it manages NGINX in a Kubernetes native manner. This package deploys 2 NGINX Controllers, one with ingress class `external` to serve public traffic, and one with ingress class `internal` to serve internal traffic.

## Requirements

- Kubernetes >= `1.20.0`
- Kustomize >= `v3`

## Image repository and tag

- Ingress NGINX image: `k8s.gcr.io/ingress-nginx/controller:1.1.0`
- Ingress NGINX repo: [https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx)

## Configuration

Ingress NGINX Double is deployed with the following default configuration:

- Maximum allowed size of the client request body: `10m`
- HTTP status code used in redirects: `301`
- Metrics are scraped by Prometheus every `10s`

## Deployment

1. Add the module to your `Furyfile.yml`:

> `dual-nginx` depends on the `nginx` package, so we need to download both of them.

```yaml
bases:
  - name: ingress/nginx
    version: "v1.12.2"
  - name: ingress/dual-nginx
    version: "v1.12.2"
```

> See `furyctl` [documentation][furyctl-repo] for additional details about `Furyfile.yml` format.

2. Execute `furyctl vendor -H` to download the packages

3. Inspect the download packages under `./vendor/katalog/ingress/dual-nginx`.

4. Define a `kustomization.yaml` that includes the `./vendor/katalog/ingress/dual-nginx` directory as resource.

```yaml
resources:
- ./vendor/katalog/ingress/dual-nginx
```

5. Apply the necessary patches. You can find a list of common customization [here](#common-customizations).

6. To deploy the packages to your cluster, execute:

```bash
kustomize build . | kubectl apply -f -
```

Your are now ready to expose your applications using Kubernetes `Ingress` objects.

## Common customizations

`nginx` package is deployed by default as a `DaemonSet`, meaning that it will deploy 1 ingress-controller pod on every worker node.

This is probably NOT what you want, standard Fury clusters have at least 1 `infra` node (nodes that are dedicated to run Fury infrastructural components, like Prometheus, elasticsearch, and the ingress controllers).

If your cluster has `infra` nodes you should patch the daemonset adding the `NodeSelector` for the `infra` nodes to the Ingress `DaemonSet`. You can do this usiing the following kustomize patch:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: nginx-ingress-controller-external
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        node-kind.sighup.io/infra: ""
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: nginx-ingress-controller-internal
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        node-kind.sighup.io/infra: ""
```

If you don't have infra nodes and you don't want to run ingress-controllers on all your worker nodes, you should probably label some nodes and adjust the previous `NodeSelector` accordingly.

## Alerts

Followings Prometheus [alerts][prometheus-alerts] are already defined for this package.
