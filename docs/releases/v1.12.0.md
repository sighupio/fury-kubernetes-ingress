## Known Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

- `Forecastle` is not supported in the versions `1.22` and `1.23` of Kubernetes
- This release involves recreation of certain resources like daemonset, deployments, etc. We recommend deleting it with `--cascade=orphan`, to avoid changes being made to the pods.
- We drop support of Kubernetes versions <= v1.19.x, this is especially
  important for Ingress due to its deprecation of `apiVersions`

## Breaking Changes üíî

- `cert-manager`:  Following their deprecation in version 1.11.0, the cert-manager APIVersions `v1alpha2`, `v1alpha3`, and `v1beta1` are no longer served.This means if your deployment manifests contain any of these API versions, you will not be able to deploy them after upgrading
- [#55](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-kubernetes-ingress/pull/55) Added Kubernetes labels to all the components of the module: Since `labels` are immutable fields in deployments, daemonsets, etc., this change requires a recreation of those resources.

## Features üí•

- [#54](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-kubernetes-ingress/pull/54) Added e2e-test support for k8s runtime `1.23`
- [#55](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-kubernetes-ingress/pull/55) Added Kubernetes labels to all the components of the module
- [#55](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-kubernetes-ingress/pull/55) Added Makefile, JSON builder and .bumpversion config to the module
- [#56](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-kubernetes-ingress/pull/56) Updated the
  `certmanager` CRDs to drop `apiVersion` support < `v1` and some syncing with upstream

## Bug Fixes üêû

- [#580148](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-kubernetes-ingress/commit/580148d789ccb01b455196985f5b455a42f0f07f) Fixed broken Ingress Config for Pomerium

## Update Guide ü¶Æ

### Warnings

- Since the release ships changes to some immutable fields, if `deployments` and `daemonsets`, are not deleted first before applying the module, it will error out.
- Make sure none of the `cert-manager` CRDs like `Certificate`, `ClusterIssuer`,
  `Challenge`, etc. are using `apiVersion` < `v1`
- Make sure you use the latest Ingress syntax following version `1.22` of Kubernetes.

### Process

To upgrade this core module from `v1.11.x` to `v1.12.0`, you need to download this new version, then apply the `kustomize` project.

```bash
kubectl -n cert-manager delete deployment.apps/cert-manager deployment.apps/cert-manager-cainjector deployment.apps/cert-manager-webhook --cascade=orphan
kustomize build katalog/cert-manager | kubectl apply -f - # This might need to be applied twice, if the deployments haven't come back up fast
# And
kubectl -n ingress-nginx delete deployment.apps/forecastle --cascade=orphan
kustomize build katalog/forecastle | kubectl apply -f -
# And
kubectl -n pomerium delete deployment.apps/pomerium --cascade=orphan
kustomize build katalog/pomerium | kubectl apply -f -
# And
kubectl -n ingress-nginx delete daemonset.apps/nginx-ingress-controller --cascade=orphan
kustomize build katalog/nginx | kubectl apply -f -
# Or
kubectl -n ingress-nginx delete daemonset.apps/nginx-ingress-controller-external daemonset.apps/nginx-ingress-controller-internal --cascade=orphan
kustomize build katalog/dual-nginx | kubectl apply -f -
# Or
kubectl -n ingress-nginx delete daemonset.apps/nginx-ingress-controller --cascade=orphan
kustomize build katalog/nginx-gke | kubectl apply -f -
# Or
kubectl -n ingress-nginx delete daemonset.apps/nginx-ingress-controller --cascade=orphan
kustomize build katalog/nginx-ovh | kubectl apply -f -
```
