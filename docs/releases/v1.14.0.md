## Bug Fixes üêû

- cert-manager: missing RBAC permissions for leader election ([#92](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-kubernetes-ingress/issues/92))

## Update Guide ü¶Æ

### Process

To upgrade this core module from `v1.13.0` to `v1.13.1`, you need to download this new version, and apply the instructions below.

Please refer the release notes of the minor version [`v1.13.0`](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-kubernetes-ingress/releases/tag/v1.13.0) if you are upgrading from a version `< v1.13.0`

> :warning: **WARNING** some downtime on cert-manager is expected during the upgrade process.

Because we are changing immutable fields (labels) of deployments, you'll need delete first cert-manager deployments to update them.

```bash
# Delete cert-manager deployments to update labels
kubectl delete -n cert-manager deployments.apps cert-manager cert-manager-webhook cert-manager-cainjector
# finally
kustomize build <your-project-path> | kubectl apply -f -
```
