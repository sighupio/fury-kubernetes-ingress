## Bug Fixes üêû

- Alert Rules now use `description` field instead of `message` for detailed information, making the Monitoring module show the needed information in Slack notifications.

## New features üåü

- Updated cert-manager
- Updated NGINX Ingress Controller
- NGINX Ingress Controller now has a Webhook that validates Config snippets and rejects changes that would break the ingress.
- Updated Forecastle and added custom Fury branding
- Added `external-dns` to the module to manage DNS records natively from Kubernetes
- Added `aws-cert-manager` to manage IAM permissions on AWS with Terraform for cert-manager
- Added `aws-external-dns` to manage IAM permissions on AWS with Terraform for external-dns

## Breaking Changes üíî

- Pomerium has been removed from this module. You can find Pomerium, and other related tools, in the new [KFD Auth module](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-kubernetes-auth).
- Removed `nginx-ldap` from the module.
- Removed `nginx-gke` from the module.
- Removed `nginx-ovh` from the module.
- NGINX Ingress Controller now uses `.spec.ingressClassName` field instead of annotations to choose between `internal` and `external` ingresses.
- NGINX Ingress Controller now depends on cert-manager for the Validating Webhook TLS certificates.
- cert-manager has been bumped several versions, please check the upgrade guides in the official docs, in particular the change from 1.7 to 1.8 includes some changes to the `spec.privateKey.rotationPolicy` field, read carefuly if you were using it or you had the `--feature-gates=ServerSideApply=true` flag in the cert-manager controller. Here you can find the relevant upgrade docs:

## Update Guide ü¶Æ

### Process

To upgrade this core module from `>= v1.12.2` to `v1.13.0`, you need to download this new version, and apply the instructions below.

> :warning: : some downtime of the nginx ingress controller is expected during the upgrade process.

```bash
kubectl delete ingressclass nginx -n ingress-nginx
# or
kubectl delete ingressclass external internal -n ingress-nginx
# then
kustomize build katalog | kubectl apply -f -
```

FIXME: this sections depends on testing the nginx upgrade and the cert-manager upgrade
FIXME: add instructions for the new Terraform pieces.
