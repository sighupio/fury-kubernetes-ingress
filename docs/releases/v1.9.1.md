# Ingress Core Module version 1.9.1

This release contains a hotfix in the [cert-manager](../../katalog/cert-manager) and the [ingress](../../katalog/nginx)
packages.

## Changelog

- FIX: Issue #37. ServiceMonitor can not match the right service.
- FIX: The logging module can not parse `dot` keys in the label field.

## Upgrade path

Before upgrade this core module from `v1.9.0` to `v1.9.1`, delete some objects as they do not allow patch in place,
this shouldn't cause downtime in the application side.

```bash
$ kubectl -n cert-manager delete deployment cert-manager-webhook cert-manager-cainjector cert-manager
deployment.apps "cert-manager-webhook" deleted
deployment.apps "cert-manager-cainjector" deleted
deployment.apps "cert-manager" deleted
```

Finally, download this new version, then apply the
`kustomize` projects.

```bash
$ kustomize build katalog/cert-manager | kubectl apply -f -
$ kustomize build katalog/nginx | kubectl apply -f -
# or
kustomize build katalog/dual-nginx | kubectl apply -f -
# or
kustomize build katalog/nginx-gke | kubectl apply -f -
# or
kustomize build katalog/nginx-ovh | kubectl apply -f -
```
